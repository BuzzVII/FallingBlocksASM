# FallingBlocksASM

This is a version of the falling blocks game I've been writting to learn and practice assembly.

It isnt' fully working yet, and will probably ~~be sometime before it is~~ never be finished (~~PhD~~ ~~Work~~ kids are getting in the way)

Compiles using NASM and is meant to be run on linux, but should be portable to other platforms with some changes.

## Dependencies

Install nasm and make
```bash
sudo apt install nasm make
```

## Build and Run

To build run 
```bash
make
``` 

Then to run
```bash
./fallingblocks
```
